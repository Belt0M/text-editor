					<div><span class='editable'>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a really cool technlogy that can help teachers
							in the classroom. There are many ways that AI can be used to make learning more fun and interesting for
							students. One way is by using a tool called Canva's "text-to-image" feature. With this tool, teachers can
							tell the computer what they want to see in a picture, and then the computer will create it. This can be
							really helpful for English Language Learners, or ELL students, because they can use images to help them
							learn new words and ideas.</span></div>
					<div><span class='editable'>Another way that AI can be used in the classroom is through online writing tools
							like Quill and Duolingo. These tools use something called adaptive learning, which means that they can
							figure out what students need help with and give them activities to practice those skills. It's like
							having a personal tutor!</span></div>
					<div><span class='editable'>AI can also be used to help students with their pronunciation. There are websites
							like English Central and Speakable that can listen to students speak and give them feedback on how to
							improve. This can be really helpful for ELL students who are learning to speak English.</span></div>
					<div><span class='editable'>Even though AI can be really helpful, there are some things we need to be careful
							about. For example, AI doesn't always give us the right information. It's important to double-check what
							we learn from AI and make sure it's correct. Also, AI doesn't have feelings or a moral compass like humans
							do. That means we need to be careful about how we use AI and make sure it's being used in a good
							way.</span></div>
					<div><span class='editable'>In conclusion, AI is a really cool technology that can help teachers in the
							classroom. It can help us learn new words and ideas, practice our writing and speaking skills, and get
							feedback on our pronunciation. But we also need to be careful and make sure we use AI in a responsible
							way.</span></div>

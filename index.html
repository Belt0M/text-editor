				<div><span class='editable'>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a really cool technlogy that can help teachers in
						the classroom. There are many ways that AI can be used to make learning more fun and interesting for
						students. One way is by using a tool called Canva's "text-to-image" feature. With this tool, teachers can
						tell the computer what they want to see in a picture, and then the computer will create it. This can be
						really helpful for English Language Learners, or ELL students, because they can use images to help them
						learn new words and ideas.</span></div>
				<div><span class='editable'>Another way that AI can be used in the classroom is through online writing tools
						like Quill and Duolingo. These tools use something called adaptive learning, which means that they can
						figure out what students need help with and give them activities to practice those skills. It's like having
						a personal tutor!</span></div>
				<div><span class='editable'>AI can also be used to help students with their pronunciation. There are websites
						like English Central and Speakable that can listen to students speak and give them feedback on how to
						improve. This can be really helpful for ELL students who are learning to speak English.</span></div>
				<div><span class='editable'>Even though AI can be really helpful, there are some things we need to be careful
						about. For example, AI doesn't always give us the right information. It's important to double-check what we
						learn from AI and make sure it's correct. Also, AI doesn't have feelings or a moral compass like humans do.
						That means we need to be careful about how we use AI and make sure it's being used in a good way.</span>
				</div>
				<div><span class='editable'>In conclusion, AI is a really cool technology that can help teachers in the
						classroom. It can help us learn new words and ideas, practice our writing and speaking skills, and get
						feedback on our pronunciation. But we also need to be careful and make sure we use AI in a responsible
						way.</span></div>
